Currently 4 models have been implemented,

Content-based filtering(con_fil):
- Genre-based
- Synopsis-based
  
Collaborative filtering(col_fil):
- Item-item similarity
- Matrix Factorization

The learnt models for Matrix Factorization are saved as model_weights.pth(int) files, where (int) is the epoch the model was saved. 

To Do:
  Make a user-facing system that uses said models.
